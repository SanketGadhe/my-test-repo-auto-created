## Frontend (Android Client) Architecture

### Overall Process Note

Given the "Android calculator app" is strictly client-side with no web frontend, no backend, no database, and no authentication, the typical "BE-first" and "BE agent" steps in this process will be omitted. All subsequent "FE" steps refer to native Android client-side development using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

### Proposed Folder Structure (Initial)

The application will adopt a modularized approach, even for its current single-screen scope, to ensure a solid foundation. The primary feature will be `calculator`, with potential `common` or `core-ui` modules for shared components.

(Detailed structure to be appended upon agent response.)
