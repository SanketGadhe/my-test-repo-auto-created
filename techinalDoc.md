### 5. API Needs

Based on the Product Requirements Document (PRD) which specifies a client-side, single-screen application focused on basic arithmetic, there are **no external API integrations required** for the Calculator App.

**Rationale:**

The core functionalities of the calculator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are entirely computational and can be executed locally within the application's JavaScript environment. There are no requirements for:

*   Fetching dynamic content or data from a backend server.
*   Persisting user data (e.g., calculation history) in a remote database.
*   Integrating with third-party services for advanced mathematical functions, unit conversions, or currency exchange rates.
*   User authentication or any form of backend communication.

All application state, including input values, operators, and results, will be managed client-side using React's state management capabilities within the `useCalculator` custom hook. The application is designed to be fully self-contained on the user's device.

**ADR Log:**

*   **Decision:** No external API integrations required.
*   **Context:** The PRD clearly defines the Calculator App as a client-side, single-screen application for basic arithmetic, with no mention of features that would necessitate external data or services.
*   **Consequence:** Simplifies the architecture, reduces development time, and eliminates dependencies on external services. The application remains fully self-contained and operates entirely on the device.
