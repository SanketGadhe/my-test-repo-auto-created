- **CalculatorScreen.tsx**: Single screen component rendering:
  - **Display:** Shows the full input expression dynamically.
  - **Keypad:** Numeric buttons (0â€“9), decimal, operators (+, -, *, /), backspace, AC, and equals.

No routing or navigation is implemented as app is single-screen only.

CalculatorScreen manages input state and triggers evaluation on '=' press.
