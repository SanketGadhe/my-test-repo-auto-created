## Frontend Architecture - Folder Structure

The frontend application will follow a modular and scalable folder structure designed for clarity, maintainability, and extensibility. The core principle is to group files by their type and responsibility.

```
src/
├── api/             # API service definitions, client instances, and related data fetching logic
├── assets/          # Static assets: images, icons, fonts
│   ├── images/
│   ├── icons/
│   └── fonts/
├── components/      # Reusable UI components, categorized by their scope and reusability
│   ├── shared/      # Highly generic components (e.g., Button, Modal, Card, Input)
│   ├── ui/          # More specific UI elements, often composed of `shared` components (e.g., FormField, DataDisplay, ProgressIndicator)
│   └── layout/      # Components defining the application's structural layout (e.g., Header, Footer, Sidebar, MainLayout)
├── config/          # Application-wide configurations: API endpoints, constants, environment variables, feature flags
├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks for encapsulating and reusing stateful logic
├── pages/           # Top-level application views, each corresponding to a distinct route
│   ├── HomePage/         # e.g., src/pages/HomePage/index.tsx, src/pages/HomePage/HomePage.module.css
│   ├── DashboardPage/
│   ├── ResumeBuilderPage/
│   ├── PortfolioAnalysisPage/
│   ├── AuthPage/
│   └── NotFoundPage/
├── styles/          # Global styling: base CSS, variables, themes, utility classes
│   ├── base.css      # Resets, typography defaults
│   ├── variables.css # CSS variables for colors, spacing, etc.
│   └── theme.css     # Theming-related styles
├── utils/           # General utility functions: formatters, validators, date/time helpers, array manipulation
├── types/           # TypeScript type definitions and interfaces
├── App.tsx          # Main application component, typically responsible for routing setup
├── index.tsx        # Application's entry point (React DOM rendering)
└── react-app-env.d.ts # TypeScript declaration file for environment variables (if applicable)
```

**Key Principles:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each directory has a clear, singular responsibility.
- **Modularity**: Code is broken down into small, manageable, and independent units.
- **Scalability**: The structure is designed to accommodate future growth and new features without becoming disorganized.
- **Discoverability**: Developers can quickly find relevant files based on their function.
